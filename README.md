# Pocket-Calendar

First attempt at InDesign scripts from a person who saw InDesing for the first time only couple days ago. 
Purpose: make universal at glance tiny calendar for keeping track of any kind of maintenance. 
Generates any year with different language locales.
Creates "style" objects whenever it's possible for easier tuning.

ToDo: highlighting, dialogs for easier tuning, watching events and dealing with overflows (called "overset" in InDesign, to make it more comfusing there's "overprint" term too - not clear yet on how to manage this), making tiles for printing calendars on small cards and stickers.
