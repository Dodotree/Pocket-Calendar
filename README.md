# Pocket-Calendar

Purpose: automation of making universal "at glance" tiny calendars for keeping track of any kind of maintenance. I find those pocket calendars very useful as cards or stickers, but creating them by hand each year is a daunting task.
Generates any year with different language locales.
Creates "style" objects whenever it's possible for easier tuning.

ToDo: 
- [ ] highlight holidays 
- [ ] dialogs for easier tuning: year, language, Sunday/Monday first, list of holidays
- [ ] watching events and dealing with overflows after style changes
- [ ] scaling down, making tiles for printing calendars on small cards and stickers.
